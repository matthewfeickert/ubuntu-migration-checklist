## Backups before Install

   - This is for an emergency restore, not a transfer
   - Manually copy all files desired to a segment of the external hard drive
* Make a list of all software to reinstall
   - Only restore files, not applications
* Make a backup of TabBuddy
* Make a list of all Docker images to pull again
